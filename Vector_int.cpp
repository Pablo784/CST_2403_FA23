/*
Here are the instructions for part 2 of assignment 3

Write a complete program that will do the following:
a) Declare an empty integer vector (without mentioning any size).

b) Use a loop to read in 20 numbers, each of which is between 10 and 100,
inclusive. As each number is read from user, validate it (i.e. check whether it
is between 10 and 100).

c) Store the valid number in the vector only if it isnâ€™t a duplicate of a number
already in vector. Use push_back function to add each unique value to the
vector.

d) Display only the unique valid values that the user entered. (Hint: print
vector)
