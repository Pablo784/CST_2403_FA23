The professor provided the solution for the classwork. Credit goes to the
professor.

2.	State the values of each of these integer variables after the
calculation is performed. Assume that, when each statement begins executing, all
variables have the integer value 5.

#2 is done below

a) product *= x++;
  product = product * x++
        = 5 * 5
  product = 25, x = 6;

b) quotient /= ++x;
  quotient = quotient / ++x
            = 5/6
  quotient = 0, x = 6;



  Ask the professor in class what no viable overloaded means

The Professor said that No Viable Overloaded means:"You need to put them seperately"
